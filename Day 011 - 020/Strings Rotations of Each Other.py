# You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

# Note: A string is a rotation of another if it can be formed by moving characters from the start to the end (or vice versa) without rearranging them.

# Examples :

# Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.
# Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "aba"
# Output: true
# Explanation: After 1 left rotation, s1 will become equal to s2.
# Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd"
# Output: false
# Explanation: Strings are not rotations of each other.

class Solution:
    def areRotations(self, s1, s2):
        # code here
        if len(s1)!=len(s2):
            return False
        
        return s2 in (s1+s1)
